# PythonPlay

Learning and playing with python and pygame.
Some things may not make logical sense as I'll be playing with what does/does not work, causes crashes, following the logic, intentionally and unintentionally breaking it.

This should not be expected to be a polished project, but rather a coding equivalent to doodles on a notecard.

1 --Installed python added to C: PATH
